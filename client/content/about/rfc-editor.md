# About the RFC Editor

The RFC Editor is made up of several different groups who work together to edit, publish, and archive [RFCs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIzY1ZT_PJTOxacaFkAauUZ2p3eMPtui_v5RKORjyiw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.iikducyomqip).

The current RFC Editor operating structure is defined in [RFC 9280](/info/rfc9280/) and comprises the following groups.

## RSWG

The [RFC Series Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rswg/about/) (RSWG) generates policy proposals regarding the publication of RFCs. It is an open working group, and all interested parties are welcome to participate in policy development.

## RSAB

The [RFC Series Approval Board](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rsab/about/) (RSAB) approves proposals generated by the RSWG. It provides "checks and balances" for the output of the RSWG and considers the long-term health of each stream and the RFC Series. The RSAB includes the following:

- representatives from each stream
- the RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE)
- the IETF LLC Director (ex officio)
- an RPC representative (ex officio)

## RSCE

The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a senior technical publishing professional who provides expert advice to the RFC Production Center (RPC) and RSAB on how to implement established policies on an ongoing and operational basis. This includes raising support or concerns for proposed policy updates and initiating proposed policy changes within the RSWG.

## RPC

The RFC Production Center (RPC) is a team of professional editors that [prepares and publishes RFCs](/authors/rfc-edit/). Once Internet-Drafts are approved by the various streams, the editors format and edit the documents, and then they work with the authors to produce publication-ready RFCs per defined policies and guidelines.
