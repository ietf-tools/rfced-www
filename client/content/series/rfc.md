# What Is an RFC?

RFCs are documents that describe Internet Standards, as well as technical methods, research and other information related to the Internet and Internet-connected systems.

The first RFC (Requests for Comments) was written in 1969 by Steve Crocker to organize notes related to the development of ARPANET, which paved the way for the modern Internet. Later RFCs established the foundations of the Internet itself. And today, thousands of volunteers continue to write these documents as a way to share and standardize information around the globe.

Anyone is welcome to [participate in the creation of RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/participate/get-started/). You can join a [working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/) in your area of interest by subscribing to the mailing list, participating in discussions, and contributing to the Internet-Drafts that may one day be published as an RFC.

Once an RFC is published, its contents do not change. Updates and obsoletions are noted in the metadata for each RFC, and [errata](/series/rfc-errata/) may be filed for any issues with the documents.

RFCs are produced via five streams:

- **The Internet Engineering Task Force** ([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)) produces protocol standards, best current practices, experimental, and informational documents. This is the only stream that creates Internet Standards.
- **The Internet Research Task Force** ([IRTF](https://www.irtf.org/)) focuses on longer term research issues related to the Internet.
- **The Internet Architecture Board** ([IAB](https://www.iab.org/)) provides long-range technical direction for Internet development.
- [**Independent Submissions**](/authors/rfc-independent-submissions/) RFCs are published outside the official processes of the IETF, IAB, and IRTF but are relevant to the Internet community.
- **Editorial** RFCs are produced by the RFC Series Working Group ([RSWG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/rswg/about/)) and document the process of publishing RFCs.

For more history of the series, see:

- RFC 2555: [30 Years of RFCs](/info/rfc2555/)
- RFC 5540: [40 Years of RFCs](/info/rfc5540/)
- RFC 8700: [50 Years of RFCs](/info/rfc8700/)

The official [International Standard Serial Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISSN) (ISSN) of the RFC Series is 2070-1721.
