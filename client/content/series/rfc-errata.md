# Errata in RFCs

Authors and editors of RFCs carefully proofread every document prior to publication, but sometimes errors happen. Because RFCs do not change after publication, there is an errata system to note these errors.

Errata are listed in the Errata section of the sidebar for each RFC when they exist. Errata with a Verified status have been reviewed and are considered accurate. Errata are not incorporated into the TXT, PDF, or XML formats of RFCs. Errata only appear in the display version or the downloadable HTML version that specifically includes errata.

### Types of Errata

- **Technical**. There is an error in the technical content of the RFC.
- **Editorial**. There is a spelling, grammar, punctuation, syntax, or formatting error that does not affect the technical content of the RFC.

### Errata Statuses

- **Reported.** The erratum has been reported but has not been verified.
- **Verified**. The erratum has been edited as necessary and verified by the appropriate parties.
- **Rejected**. The erratum was redundant or incorrect and has been discarded.
- **Held for Document Update**. The erratum is not a necessary update to the RFC. However, it should be considered in future revisions of the RFC.

### How to Report an Erratum

If you find an error, you can report an erratum for the RFC.

1. Check if an erratum for the topic already exists. Remember to check rejected errata and errata that have been held for document updates, not just the verified errata.
2. If no related erratum exists, click the "Report a new erratum" button in the sidebar of the RFC.
3. Fill out the form provided with the appropriate information. You will receive email notifications about your errata as it is processed.

Further information on how errata reports are handled exists in:

- [IESG Processing of RFC Errata for the IETF Stream](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/statement-iesg-iesg-processing-of-rfc-errata-for-the-ietf-stream-20210507/).
